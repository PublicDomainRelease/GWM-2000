Summary of GWM-2000



ABSTRACT

GWM-2000 is a Groundwater Management Process for the U.S. Geological Survey 
modular three-dimensional groundwater model, MODFLOW-2000. GWM-2005 uses a 
response-matrix approach to solve several types of linear, nonlinear, and 
mixed-binary linear groundwater management formulations. Each management 
formulation consists of a set of decision variables, an objective function, 
and a set of constraints. Three types of decision variables are supported  
by GWM-2000: flow-rate decision variables, which are withdrawal or injection 
rates at well sites; external decision variables, which are sources or sinks  
of water that are external to the flow model and do not directly affect the
state variables of the simulated groundwater system (heads, streamflows, and  
so forth); and binary variables, which have values of 0 or 1 and are used to 
define the status of flow-rate or external decision variables. Flow-rate  
decision variables can represent wells that extend over one or more model
cells and be active during one or more model stress periods; external 
variables also can be active during one or more stress periods. A single  
objective function is supported by GWM-2000, which can be specified to either
minimize or maximize the weighted sum of the three types of decision 
variables. Four types of constraints can be specified in a GWM-2000 
formulation: upper and lower bounds on the flow-rate and external decision 
variables; linear summations of the three types of decision variables; 
hydraulic-head based constraints including drawdowns, head differences, and 
head gradients; and streamflow and streamflow-depletion constraints. 

The Response Matrix Solution (RMS) Package of GWM-2000 uses the Groundwater 
Flow Process of MODFLOW to calculate the change in head at each constraint 
location that results from a perturbation of a flow-rate variable; these 
changes are used to calculate the response coefficients. For linear 
management formulations, the resulting matrix of response coefficients is then 
combined with other components of the linear management formulation to form a 
complete linear formulation; the formulation is then solved by use of the 
simplex algorithm, which is incorporated into the RMS Package. Nonlinear
formulations arise for simulated conditions that include water-table 
(unconfined) aquifers or head-dependent boundary conditions (such as streams, 
drains, or evapotranspiration from the water table). Nonlinear formulations 
are solved by sequential linear programming; that is, repeated linearization 
of the nonlinear features of the management problem. In this approach, 
response coefficients are recalculated for each iteration of the solution 
process. Mixed-binary linear (or mildly nonlinear) formulations are solved 
by use of the branch and bound algorithm, which is also incorporated into 
the RMS Package.


HISTORY

Version 1.1.4 2011/6  - correct bug that may affect problems with both binary
variables and external variables. 

Version 1.1.3 2009/12 - MF2000-GWM is renamed GWM-2000. 

Version 1.1.2 2009/06 - Bug fix that caused code failure when equality 
summation constraints were imposed on binary variables. Bug fix to 
correct output for SLP runs. 

Version 1.1.1 2007/03 - Reconstructed from MODFLOW-2000 Version 1.17.02 
so that the GMG solver can be used. Bug fixed that caused improper 
reading of response matrix when both head and stream constraints are 
present. 

Version 1.1 2006/08 - New features added to output the response coefficients 
in a formatted file, the optimal values of the flow variables in a file 
formatted similarly to a MODFLOW WEL file, the solution at each iteration of 
the SLP algorithm, the status of summation constraints and additional screen 
and file output reporting on algorithm progress. Additional controls on SLP 
algorithm added. Several minor clean-ups and improvements. Many of these 
features are described in the online PDF called "GWM Addendum." 

Version 1.0.3 2006/01/21 - Correct a bug that caused incorrect reading of  
flow process files when certain combinations of variables are read using the 
parameter input structure.  Correct several bugs related to proper input 
when non-zero base and/or reference flows are specified and when the response 
matrix file is written or read.  New features added to SLP to check for dry 
cells at wells and to better control iterations. 

Version 1.0.2 2005/09/24 - Correct a compiler setting in the Version 1.0.1 
executable that prevented opening of binary files.  Add ability to comment
lines in GWM file.  Several minor improvements to output. 

Version 1.0.1 2005/07/29 - Fix a bug that caused incomplete checking for 
feasibility of binary-only summation constraints.  Fix an output bug that 
caused improper reporting of range analysis for stream depletion and 
drawdown constraints.  Several minor improvements to output appearance and 
input checking. 

Version 1.0.0 2005/02 - Initial release, built from MODFLOW-2000 Version 1.13
