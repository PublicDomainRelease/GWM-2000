                           GWM-2000 Release Notes

     This file describes changes introduced into GWM-2000 with each
official release.

Version 1.1.3; 7 December 2009
	MF2000-GWM is renamed GWM-2000. 


============ Prior versions were named MF2000-GWM ==========================

Version 1.1.2 2009/06
        Bug fix that caused code failure when equality summation constraints 
        were imposed on binary variables. Bug fix to correct output for SLP 
        runs. 

Version 1.1.1 2007/03
        Reconstructed from MODFLOW-2000 Version 1.17.02 so that the GMG solver
        can be used. Bug fixed that caused improper reading of response 
        matrix when both head and stream constraints are present. 

Version 1.1 2006/08
        New features added to output the response coefficients in a 
        formatted file, the optimal values of the flow variables in a file 
        formatted similarly to a MODFLOW WEL file, the solution at each 
        iteration of the SLP algorithm, the status of summation constraints 
        and additional screen and file output reporting on algorithm 
        progress. Additional controls on SLP algorithm added. Several minor
        clean-ups and improvements. Many of these features are described in 
        the online PDF called "GWM Addendum." 

Version 1.0.3 2006/01/21
        Correct a bug that caused incorrect reading of flow process files when 
        certain combinations of variables are read using the parameter input 
        structure.  Correct several bugs related to proper input when non-
        zero base and/or reference flows are specified and when the response 
        matrix file is written or read.  New features added to SLP to check 
        for dry cells at wells and to better control iterations. 

Version 1.0.2 2005/09/24 
        Correct a compiler setting in the Version 1.0.1 executable that 
        prevented opening of binary files.  Add ability to comment lines in 
        GWM file.  Several minor improvements to output. 

Version 1.0.1 2005/07/29 
        Fix a bug that caused incomplete checking for feasibility of binary-
        only summation constraints.  Fix an output bug that caused improper 
        reporting of range analysis for stream depletion and drawdown 
        constraints.  Several minor improvements to output appearance and 
        input checking. 

Version 1.0.0 2005/02 - Initial release, built from MODFLOW-2000 Version 1.13
